<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

* JDK 17 [https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/17](https://jdk.java.net/java-se-ri/17)
* Gradle [https://gradle.org/install/](https://gradle.org/install/)
* MySQL [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/installer/)

### Recommended Tools
* IntelliJ Community [https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/)
* Postman [https://www.postman.com/downloads/](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
2. Change directory
   ```sh
   cd food-court-microservice
   ```
3. Create a new database in MySQL called food_court_microservice
4. Update the database connection settings (If necessary, change the localhost port if you have another port for MySQL)
   ```yml
   # src/main/resources/application-dev.yml
   spring:
      datasource:
          url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/food_court_microservice
          username: root
          password: <your-password>
   ```
5. After the tables are created, it is necessary to run the other microservice "user-microservice" to be able to consume the authentication token
   * Open Swagger UI in the following path: [http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui/index.html](http://localhost:8090/swagger-ui/index.html), then look for the /auth/login endpoint and copy the login it generates when entering valid credentials.
   * The next step is to paste the token in the pop-up generated by the "Authorize" button of the Swagger of this microservice.
6. Then you can make use of the restaurant endpoints, you should be aware that some have restrictions on the role of the user who is logging in.
